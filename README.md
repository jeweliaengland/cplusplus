# cplusplus
In this project, I needed to display both a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock on the Chada website. These clocks would make the website more accesible for international cliets. The program needed to be able to get the iniotial time, add an hour, add a minute, and add a second. It would then display these clocks. I think that I particularly did well at the actual display of the clocks. I thought it would have gone well on the website and met all of the qualifications. I think it would be great if the clock could actually work in liove time. Meaning taking the time that it actyally is from anywhere around the world and automatically update. Something that I struggled with the most in this project was just figuring out where to begin with my code and getting my while loop correct. Working with cplusplus for the first time was definitely difficult. Doing a psuedocode ahead of time was very helpful for me. I have learned a lot of skills from this project. Specifically, this was my first project I did that actually output a display, in this case, a clock. I will also definitely be using all the skills I learned in C++ far into the future both in school and my proffesional career. I was able to make this project adaptable by having the function to add a minute, hour, and second. This way, no matter what the input time is, the user can make the display say whatever time they want.
